#whats the topic

this is my personal rocket engine projekt of the build of a pulsar jet engine im developing the engine completly on my own so from the idea to the design to the test.this reposatory dokuments my progress,mistakes and my succses
my goal is it to realy understand the technick not only theoreticly also practical. Besides this i also want to prepare my self witch this projekt for studies at the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)

#current progres

i am currently in the planing phase current progress

1. first prototype
2. first designs and sketches on Paper
3. basic information about the pulsar engines
4. projekt for ducumentation on github

#next steps

1. tests on the first prototype
2. creating of sketches
3. optimizing of the prototype so it runs perfectly in the end
4. creation of an webside for full documentation of other and future projekts

#why do i do all of this

im intesrestet in aerospace since years (engineerin) with this projekt i want to:

1. learn how rocket engines work
2.  collect praktikal expirience
3. to show that even as a pupil you can do big
4. a ground for competitions and for my future aplycation at the MIT

Goal of the Projekt is

to develop pulsjet engines working on the easy prinzipial of an jamjet engine for experimental and test uses i also want to understand the engine the physik behind it and also the different nozzle forms and types and how the fuel impacts the thrust of the jet engine

this projekt is the entry for the world of rocketscience and is the beginning of komplex development for the future


Funktion of the jam jet engine 


the jamjet engine ist a simple air breathing jet engine without moving parts the thrust is generated due to small explosions in the Combustionchamber
to start the engine you fill a little bit of the lower part with an Engine fule (ethanol) you let it then sit for a while so the gas air mixture can form and can expand inside of the jar then you ignite the gas in the jar wich will cause an explosion inside of the jar
which generates a high amount of pressure which will then fire the hot gases out of the nozzle that generates thrust (3 newton law) due to the fast pressure switch negative pressure builds up which then sucks innew air also through the nozzle thats why the prozes repeats itsself

the engine uses an selfingnition zykle to generate the thrust
